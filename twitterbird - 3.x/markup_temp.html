<p><b>military:</b> Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Can\xe2\x80\x99t let that happen!</p><p><b>border:</b> For those asking, the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate, and they need 60. That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election! We can then be even tougher on  Crime (and Border), and even better to our Military &amp; Veterans!</p><p><b>border:</b> Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border. They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. <a href="/hashtag/WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18?src=hash" data-query-source="hashtag_click" class="twitter-hashtag pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" ><s>#</s><b>WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18</b></a> in order to power through mess!</p><p><b>border:</b> Not looking good for our great Military or Safety &amp; Security on the very dangerous Southern Border. Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts, and what they are doing for our booming economy.</p><p><b>military:</b> Excellent preliminary meeting in Oval with <a href="/SenSchumer" class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" data-mentioned-user-id="17494010" ><s>@</s><b>SenSchumer</b></a> - working on solutions for Security and our great Military together with <a href="/SenateMajLdr" class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" data-mentioned-user-id="1249982359" ><s>@</s><b>SenateMajLdr</b></a> McConnell and <a href="/SpeakerRyan" class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" data-mentioned-user-id="18916432" ><s>@</s><b>SpeakerRyan</b></a>. Making progress - four week extension would be best!</p><p><b>border:</b> Government Funding Bill past last night in the House of Representatives. Now Democrats are needed if it is to pass in the Senate - but they want illegal immigration and weak borders. Shutdown coming? We need more Republican victories in 2018!</p><p><b>military:</b> House of Representatives needs to pass Government Funding Bill tonight. So important for our country - our Military needs it!</p><p><b>america great again:</b> AMERICA will once again be a NATION that thinks big, dreams bigger, and always reaches for the stars.

We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico, now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. If there is no Wall, there is no Deal!</p><p><b>wall:</b> ....The Wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. The $20 billion dollar Wall is \xe2\x80\x9cpeanuts\xe2\x80\x9d compared to what Mexico makes from the U.S. NAFTA is a bad joke!</p>
